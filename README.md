Title of our project:

A Comparative Study of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifiers for Email Spam Detection Using TF-IDF and SMOTE

Project Summary:

This project focused on building and comparing three machine learning modelsâ€”Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, for detecting spam emails. 
Using TF-IDF for feature extraction and SMOTE to address class imbalance, we trained and evaluated each model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
The Random Forest model delivered the best overall performance. 
The project highlighted the importance of data preprocessing and model selection in building effective, real-world spam detection systems.
